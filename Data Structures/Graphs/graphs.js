//Graph terms
//Vertex = node 
//Edge = distance between them essentially 
//A tree is a special type of graph where each node is connected by only one edge

//An undirected graph is one where each edge is a two way graph 
//A directed graph is represented with arrows 

//There is also a weighted and unweighted graph. When there is a value assigned to the edges, it becomes a weighted graph

//We can store it using adjacencry matrix or adjacency list 

class Graph {

        this.adjacencyList = {}
